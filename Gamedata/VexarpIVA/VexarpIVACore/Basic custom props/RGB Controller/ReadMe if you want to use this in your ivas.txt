Hi, if you read this you probably want to use this rgb thing in your iva (or you are just curious)

you need to place only one Master divider ( it trigger the rgb.lua script ) and use the other rgb_dividers for all other dividers

the more Master divider you place de faster it gets:

One divider: 1x speed
Two dividers: 2x speed
Three dividers: 3x speed
and so on
